# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating a billing system from on-premises MySQL to AWS DynamoDB using a single table design pattern. The migration must overcome network connectivity challenges, maintain data integrity across hybrid environments, support blue-green deployment for zero downtime, and include comprehensive backfill capabilities. The system handles billing accounts, subscribers, customers, bills, charges, and service agreements with complex relationships that need to be preserved in the NoSQL structure while ensuring reliable data transfer from on-premises infrastructure to AWS cloud.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from on-premises MySQL to AWS DynamoDB with zero downtime, so that our billing system remains operational throughout the migration process despite network connectivity challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process is initiated THEN the system SHALL maintain full operational capability on the existing on-premises MySQL database
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL pause migration and resume from the last checkpoint without data loss
3. WHEN the blue-green deployment is executed THEN the system SHALL switch traffic to DynamoDB without service interruption
4. IF any issues occur during migration THEN the system SHALL provide immediate rollback capability to on-premises MySQL
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically on DynamoDB

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want to implement a single table design in DynamoDB, so that we can optimize performance and reduce costs while maintaining all existing relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the DynamoDB table THEN the system SHALL accommodate all entity types (BILLING_ACCOUNT, SUBSCRIBER, CUSTOMER, BILL, CHARGE, SERVICE_AGREEMENT) in a single table
2. WHEN querying related data THEN the system SHALL support efficient access patterns for all current use cases
3. WHEN storing hierarchical data THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity through proper partition and sort key design
4. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL support both item-level and query-based operations with optimal performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want automated migration scripts with backfill capabilities that work reliably over network connections, so that I can migrate existing data from on-premises to AWS and handle any data synchronization needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing migration scripts THEN the system SHALL transfer all existing on-premises MySQL data to AWS DynamoDB without data loss
2. WHEN network interruptions occur THEN the system SHALL resume data transfer from the last successful checkpoint
3. WHEN performing backfill operations THEN the system SHALL handle incremental data updates during the migration window using change data capture
4. IF data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and error reporting with network-specific diagnostics
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity between on-premises source and AWS target systems

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a solutions architect, I want comprehensive architecture diagrams and documentation, so that the team understands the migration strategy and new data model structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing architecture documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagrams showing the migration flow
2. WHEN examining the new data model THEN the documentation SHALL illustrate the single table design with access patterns
3. WHEN planning deployment THEN the architecture SHALL show blue-green deployment strategy with rollback procedures
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the documentation SHALL include monitoring and alerting strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new DynamoDB implementation to support all existing query patterns, so that application code changes are minimized during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying by billing account THEN the system SHALL return all related subscribers, bills, charges, and customer information
2. WHEN searching for subscriber information THEN the system SHALL efficiently retrieve subscriber details and associated service agreements
3. WHEN generating billing reports THEN the system SHALL support aggregation queries across charges and bills
4. WHEN accessing customer data THEN the system SHALL maintain privacy and security requirements equivalent to MySQL implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want monitoring and validation tools that account for network connectivity, so that I can ensure migration success and ongoing system health across on-premises and AWS environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time monitoring of network connectivity, data transfer rates, and success metrics
2. WHEN network issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert operations team and automatically implement failover procedures
3. WHEN data validation is performed THEN the system SHALL compare record counts and data integrity between on-premises MySQL and AWS DynamoDB
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide alerting and diagnostic capabilities including network latency and bandwidth utilization
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive migration reports with success metrics and network performance data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want secure and reliable network connectivity between on-premises and AWS, so that data migration can proceed safely without exposing sensitive billing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing network connectivity THEN the system SHALL support both VPN and Direct Connect options for redundancy
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher
3. WHEN network bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL implement throttling and compression to optimize data transfer
4. IF primary network connection fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup connection without data loss
5. WHEN migration is active THEN the system SHALL monitor network performance and adjust transfer rates accordingly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security controls for cross-environment data migration, so that sensitive billing data remains protected during the on-premises to AWS transfer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring access controls THEN the system SHALL implement least privilege IAM roles and policies
2. WHEN storing data in AWS THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest in S3 and DynamoDB
3. WHEN accessing on-premises systems THEN the system SHALL use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
4. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit trails in CloudTrail and on-premises logs
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately halt migration and alert security team
